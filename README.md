Repository containing source code for my Final Year Project titled 'Cyber Attack Detection and Prevention in IoT'.

The purpose of this project was to investigate a novel anomaly-based approach for an intrusion detection system.
The system relies on leveraging device-type fingeprinting in order identify a particular device via its network traffic.
The detection system is implemented in two ways, the first is by statistical methods and the second is by using timer series prediction.
